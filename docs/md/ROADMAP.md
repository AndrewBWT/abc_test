# Roadmap for abc_test #

## Current version 0.1

## Version 0.2 ##

**When we have finished the TODO list for version 0.2, we will make this repo public**

- Create the machinery required for the combinatorics gen_data instantiation to be created.
- Ensure library is able to be built outside of our environment.
- Have tutorials and examples ready, to show what it is abc-test does.
- Create README.md which provides a showcase of the functionality of the library.
- Provide some documentation for all functions which are exposed to the end user. We are not aiming for perfection, just enough so the user can get by.
- Finish off random library to work with arrays, vectors and enums.
