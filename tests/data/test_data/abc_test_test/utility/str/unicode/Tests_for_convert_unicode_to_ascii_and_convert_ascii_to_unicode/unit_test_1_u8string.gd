("hello\x80",(1, "The function convert_unicode_to_ascii encountered an error when processing the unicode input \"hello\\x80\". The error encountered is as follows; the 6th char8_t code unit in the unicode string, represented in hex as 0x80, was found to be invalid under the UTF8 standard. An attempt was made to recognise it as a leading code unit, as part of a unicode code point. However it did not meet the criteria. For a code unit to be recognised as a leading code unit, it must be inclusively between either 0x00 and 0x7F, 0xC0 and 0xDF, 0xE0 and 0xEF, or 0xF0 and 0xF7. As 0x80 did not meet these criteria, it was recognised as an invalid code unit."))
