("\\x80",(1,"The function unicode_conversion encountered an invalid code point sequence when validating its input. The error encountered is as follows; the 1st char8_t code point encountered, \"\\x80\", was found to be invalid. It was processed as a leading code point in a sequence of 4 code points. However, due to the end of the sequence of code points, only 1 code point was able to be processed.")
