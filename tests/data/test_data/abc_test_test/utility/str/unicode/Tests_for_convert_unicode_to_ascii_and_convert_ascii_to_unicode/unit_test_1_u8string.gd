("hello\x80",(1, "The function convert_unicode_to_ascii encountered an error when processing the input \"hello\\x80\". The error encountered is as follows; the 6th char8_t code unit encountered, represented in hex as 0x80, was found to be invalid under the UTF8 standard. An attempt was made to recognise it as a leading code unit as part of a unicode code point, however this was not possible. To be a leading code unit, a code unit must be inclusively between either 0x00 and 0x7F, 0xC0 and 0xDF, 0xE0 and 0xEF, or 0xF0 and 0xF7. 0x80 did not meet this criteria."))

The error encountered is as follows; the 6th char8_t code unit encountered, represented in hex as 0xC0, was found to be invalid under the UTF8 standard. It was processed as a leading code unit, in an attempt to process a unicode code point, however this was not possible. When processed as a leading code unit, 0xC0 should be the first of 2 code units making up the code point. However the sequence of code units ends after 1 code unit, meaning that it is part of an invalid code unit sequence."))

("hello\xF0\xBF\xBF\xC0",(1, "The function convert_unicode_to_ascii encountered an error when processing the input \"hello\\xF0\\xBF\\xBF\\xC0\". The error encountered is as follows; the 9th char8_t code unit encountered, represented in hex as 0xC0, was found to be invalid under the UTF8 standard. It was processed as a continuation code unit, as part of an attempt to process the sub-sequence [0xF0,0xBF,0xBF,0xC0] as a unicode code point, however this was not possible. Continuation code units must be inclusively between 0x80 and 0xBF. 0xC0 is not, therefore meaning that it is part of an invalid code unit sequence."))
("hello\xF0\x80\x81\xA1",(1, "The function convert_unicode_to_ascii encountered an error when processing the input \"hello\\xF0\\x80\\x81\\xA1\". The error encountered is as follows; when attempting to process the 6th through to the 9th char8_t code unit as a single unicode code point, an error was detected under the UTF8 standard. This error was found when processing the code unit sub-sequence [0xF0,0x80,0x81,0xA1]. After converting it to the single UTF32 code unit `a' (0x00000061 in hex), it was found that `a' can be represented using the smaller sub-sequence of char8_t code units [0x61]. Therefore, this code unit sub-sequence is invalid."))

This error was found when processing the code unit sub-sequence [0xF4,0x90,0x80,0x80]. After converting it to a single UTF32 code unit, it was found to be invalid. The UTF32 code unit in question is represented in hex as 0x00110000, and is outside the unicode range. The unicode range is inclusively from 0x00000000 to 0x0000D7FF, and from 0x0000E000 to 0x0010FFFF. As 0x00110000 is not within this range, this code unit sub-sequence is invalid."))
