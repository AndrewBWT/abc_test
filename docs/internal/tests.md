# Tests

This document contains all the todos for the tests for `abc_test`.

# General
- [ ] We will bootstrap the testing framework, however we know that this will cause problems.
- [ ] There are issues regarding running tests with faux test options and test runners. We will need to come up with a solution for these. Thankfully, we can test smaller components of the library before we get to this point.

## Files tested.
