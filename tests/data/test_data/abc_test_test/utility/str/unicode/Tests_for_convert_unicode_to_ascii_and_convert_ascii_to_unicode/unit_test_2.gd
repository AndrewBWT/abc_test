("\xA3hello",(1, "The function convert_ascii_to_unicode could not encode the char represented by the integer 163 into unicode. This is because it lies outside the basic ASCII range of 0 to 127. It is probable that this character is representable in your local character set, however convert_ascii_to_unicode_string only recognises basic ASCII, and therefore this character cannot be encoded into a unicode string representative of the input given."))
