("\xA3hello",(1, "The function convert_ascii_to_unicode encountered an error when processing the ASCII input \"\\xA3hello\". The error encountered is as follows; the 1st char type extracted from the unicode input string, represented in hex as 0xA3, lies outside the ASCII range. The ASCII range is inclusively between 0x00 and 0x7F; therefore, it was not possible to encode this char in unicode."))
